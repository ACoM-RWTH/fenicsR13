# Master Thesis

## Ideas

- Explain R13 background and theory
  - Boltzmann
  - Regularize
  - Linearize (own aproach like in PDE HW)
- Cases
  - 2D Stokes Cylinder
    - Derive analytical solution
    - Decoupled Heat System
      - Analyze condition number
      - Test GLS stabilization
    - Decoupled Flow System
    - Coupled System
- Outlook
  - See Roadmap
- Check if we can simulate a paradoxon that NSF cannot do (PDEs HW)
